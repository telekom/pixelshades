## Prerequisites

To be able to use the `dvds-cli` tool it is needed to define our GitLab's package registry and an auth token in your project.

#### Define package registry

To define the target package registry, create a `.npmrc` file in the root of your project.

After creating that folder you can paste this code into your `.npmrc` file:

```
@digital-ventures:registry=https://gitlab.devops.telekom.de/api/v4/projects/249461/packages/npm/
//gitlab.devops.telekom.de/api/v4/projects/249461/packages/npm/:_authToken="${NPM_TOKEN}"
git-tag-version=false
```

### Export NPM_TOKEN

To be able to connect to our private GitLab package registry it's needed to define a `NPM_TOKEN` in your environment.

Open your terminal and run this command:

```
export NPM_TOKEN=glpat-bEPygiayncJwCFNzx6Y2
```

If you want to make sure the export worked, you can use `printenv` to print your environment variables and search for the variable exported in the last step.

After configuring the `.npmrc` file and defining the `NPM_TOKEN` in your environment you can follow the instructions in [Usage](http://localhost:3000/docs/dvds-cli/usage) to generate your tokens.
