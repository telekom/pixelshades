The card component is a prestyled container for content. It can be used to display a title, subtitle, and content in a structured way.

To build your card you can use the `Card` component and structure it with the `Card.Header`, `Card.Body`, and `Card.Footer` primitves.
There are also predefined typography primitives for the title and subtitle of the card, you can use the `Card.Title` and `Card.Subtitle` primitives.
