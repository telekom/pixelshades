## Examples

### Controlled

<ComponentPreview name="combobox/controlled" />

### Loading Async Data

A combobox can be shown as loading by setting the `isLoading` prop to `true`.
This can be combined with the useAsyncList hook from react-stately, to make async data loading super simple.

<ComponentPreview name="combobox/loading" />
